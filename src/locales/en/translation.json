It is in this context that ACNDC was created in 2009 by a team of indigenous Batwa Banyindu women, under the guidance of Mr. Lugendo Musobokelwa Cesar, in Kasika, Mwenga Territory, South Kivu, DRC. ACNDC builds bridges through the unifying role of women as community leaders, primary educators, health agents, and regulators of economic and political balance.
